#### Story:
As a developer<br/>
I want run background tasks for my application<br/>
So that I can perform time consuming tasks in the background

#### Design options evaluated:
1. Background tasks will be run in a web dyno. We have opted for this approach. [More info](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/hosted-services?view=aspnetcore-2.2)
   - Notes:
     - If the dyno doesn't receive traffic for 30 minutes, then the dyno will goto sleep even though the background process is running.
1. Worker dyno to run background tasks in separate process.
   - Pros:
     - You can scale web and worker independently.
     - Failure of one thread will not effect the other threads.
     - This will allow logs for web and background process to stay isolated.
   - Cons:
     - Currently there is no way to run only background tasks in the web project. Or to instruct project to start only web host.
     - So, we have to add a new project and create separate assembly. We will also have to create service container in both the projects. This will create complexity and it will take more time to develop.

#### Selected design option: 1
- Reasons for the selection:
  - We want to provide developers with fastest and easiest way to deploy the initial implementation of their ideas.
  - You can easily move to more advanced approach once you validate you idea and have more resources.
- Note:
  - This way of implementation of background tasks requires on changes in our project related file.
  - We have included a sample implementation in demo Asp.net core project.
