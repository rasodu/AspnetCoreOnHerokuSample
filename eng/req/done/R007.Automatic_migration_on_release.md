#### Story:
As a developer<br/>
I want easily run database migration before release<br/>
So that I don't to remember to run migration command before the application release

#### Design options evaluated:
1. Code first
   - Notes:
     - How to [seed](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/migrations/seeding) database?
     - What are [snapshot](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/EF/Migrations-Under-the-Hood) files?
     - How to resolve code [conflict](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/teams#merging)?
     - Should you use data annotation on model fluent API?
     - How to check snapshot file is in good condition when upgrading database package? - Run ```Add-migrations <name> -IgnoreChanges``` and make sure there are no changes in snapshot file.
1. DB first
1. Code first from existing DB
   - Notes:
     - How to do this [here](https://channel9.msdn.com/blogs/ef/migrations-existing-databases) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/ef6/modeling/code-first/migrations/existing-database)?
1. SSDT project for database
   - Cons:
     - This project types can not be compiled without MsBuild.
   - Notes:
     - If we want to use this we would need to change deployment strategy.
     - Since we have to use DB first approach with this method, it will also make code complicated.

#### Selected design option: 1
- Reasons for the selection:
  - The chosen approach is the fastest way for developers to get started with creating DB migrations.
- Notes:
  - Implementation
    - User need to explicitly specify if they need to run migration. This way app don't run migrations on release if developer want to run them manually. 
    - User's can easily switch DB by changing a single package and rerunning migrations.
    - Most app would need a way to persist data. PostgreSQL is supported and maintained by Heroku. Otherwise developers would need to setup and maintain DB solution somewhere else. It would be a time consuming task. We want to allow developer to get their app quickly off the ground. Therefore, demo will run migrations against PostgreSQL server.
  - Settings
    - Set SqlConnection pool number and SqlConnection timeout number. Append ```Minimum Pool Size=19;Maximum Pool Size=19;Timeout=30;Command Timeout=30;``` to SQL connection string. Refs: [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql-server-connection-pooling#adding-connections) and [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-plans#hobby-tier) and [here](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/connection-string-parameters.html#pooling)
    - Use ```services.AddDBContextPool<DBContext>(options => options.UseSQLServer("ConnectionString"));```. Refs: [here](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/10125) and [here](https://neelbhatt.com/2018/02/27/use-dbcontextpooling-to-improve-the-performance-net-core-2-1-feature/)
