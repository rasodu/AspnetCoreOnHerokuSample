#### Story:
As a application developer<br/>
I want a simple and automatic way to run commands, with the needed tools installed in the environment, before release<br/>
So that I don't have to remember to run them manually

#### Design options evaluated:
1. Define release commands to run in Docker image in heroku.yml file
   - Pros:
     - You can install additional tools needed to run release tasks on the Docker image.
     - You can quickly recreate environment to run release tasks by building the Docker image.

#### Selected design option: 1
- Reasons for the selection:
  - No additional CD server setup is required to implement method of running the tasks this way.
