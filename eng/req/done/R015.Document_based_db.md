#### Story:
As a developer<br/>
I want to scale DB storage, read throughput and write throughput<br/>
So that I can build distributed application

#### Design options evaluated:
1. Relational databases
   - Pros:
     - Easy to increase read throughput using read replicas.
     - Point in time recovery is easy to manage and setup.
     - Data normalization is used to remove redundant data from the database and to store non-redundant/consistent data.
   - Cons:
     - Sharding to increase data storage and to increase write throughtput is difficult to implement. Sharding logic need to be implemented in application layer.
1. document databases
   - Pros:
     - Start with non-shareded collection. Shared the collection to increase storage, data read throughput and write throughput.
     - Sharding to 100% handled by database layer. No special things to implement in application.
   - Cons:
     - May need to denormalize data that it can be queried quickly. This may require locks on multiple collections when writing data.
     - Need choose correct sharding key. Sharding key can't be changes without recreating collection.
     - SQL join operation not availabe in MongoDB.
   - Notes:
     - Enforcing Document Schema is optional. You can start out quickly but if you don't enforce schema, then it may cause problem in the future.
     - Add new filed, then normalize data. But this flow is the same for both types of databases.

#### Selected design option: 1
- Reasons for the selection:
  - Allows easily to scale DB sotrage, read throughput and write throughput as needed by the application.
