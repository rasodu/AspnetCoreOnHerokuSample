#### Story:
As a creator of the package<br/>
I want to communicate release cycle for the package<br/>
So that the users of the package know when can they expect upgrades for the package

#### Design options evaluated:
1. Follow [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support-policy) LTS upgrade policy. Only spport latest LTS version.
   - Notes:
     - We will only upgrade to Asp.net Core LTS version. We will ignore current versions. Though, we will add new features that we want to add to product in backlog based on the new features introduced in current version. But we will not upgrade to current version because features added in the release are usually unstable. Implementation of new feature can change from current to LTS version release.
1. Follow dotnet upgrade policy. Suport all versions of it.
   - Pros:
     - User will be able to find Heroku deployment procedure for all versions of Asp.net Core
   - Cons:
     - Maintaining the files for all version is a lot of work.
     - There are only a few users at this point. So, the effort may not be worth the total time spend on supporting all the versions.
