#### Story:
As a developer<br/>
I want to deploy my Asp.net Core application to the web<br/>
So that others can use my application

#### Technical requirement:
Time spend on the process of setting up infrastructure should be minimized.

#### Design options evaluated:
1. Heroku
1. AWS Beanstalk
1. Azure App Service
1. Digital Ocean Kubernetes
1. Digital Ocean Droplet
1. Digital Ocean Droplet with Docker
1. Digital Ocean Droplet with Docker Swarm

#### Selected design option: 1
- Reasons for the selection:
  - The aim of the project is to provide fastest way to deploy the project. Heroku's services free developers from setting up a lot of things that they need to run production level web application. 
  - Production website should use SSL certificate. Heroku manages SSL. There is a lot of work involved in using and managing SSL certificates.
  - You will also need load balancer. Heroku takes care of this too.
  - Logging works out of the box. You would need a way to aggregate logs from multiple containers in Docker solutions.
  - Pipeline is another advantage. You can quickly setup dev and UAT test app. Without Heroku you need to setup mirror of production infrastructure for test releases.(Though, at this point Heroku doesn't allow pipeline upgrades for Docker projects)
  - Heroku also provide quick way to put website in maintenance mode. With other approaches you need to configure a way to do something similar.
  - Heroku push to deploy works out of the box. With Kubernetes would need to setup something separate to enable this. CD is implemented right into Heroku.
  - You would need to maintain the cluster with Kubernetes or other containerized workload management technology.
