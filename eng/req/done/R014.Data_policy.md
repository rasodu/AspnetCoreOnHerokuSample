#### Story:
As an application manager<br/>
I want define clear data retention policy<br/>
So that customer, developer and everyone else involved with the application developer know about the data policy.

#### Technical requirement:
- &lt;insert>

#### Design options evaluated:
1. Industry standard
   - Pros:
     - Unneeded data is removed from DB. This will make DB performance better.
   - Cons:
     - Extra technical work is involved for
       - Data scrubbing script
       - Data delete script
       - DB backup script before delete
       - DB backup script to adhere to RPO
   - Notes:
     - Data scrubbing:
       - Define data that should not be shown to anyone other than actual customer
       - Create data scrubbing script
     - Data retention:
       - Talk to customer and define the number of day/month/year that data needs to be retain
       - Need to talk full DB backup before deleting the old data
     - RPO(Recovery Point Objective):
       - Define the RTO time(usually in hours) by talking to customer
       - Execute the DB backup script at RPO time
     - RTO(Recovery Time Objective):
       - Define the RPO time(usually in hours) by talking to customer
       - Create the BCP environment that can be brought up in less than the RTO time

#### Selected design option: 1
