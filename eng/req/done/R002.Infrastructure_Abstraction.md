#### Story:
As a developer<br/>
I want make sure the app is not tied to cloud platform<br/>
So that I can migrate the app to other platform in the future


#### Design options evaluated:
1. Third party Heroku build packs for Asp.net Core
1. Deploy using docker image

#### Selected design option: 2
- Reasons for the selection:
  - There is a possibility that a build pack could fail. Docker provides very reliable way to run projects in production.
  - If it works on developer's machine, then it will always work on production too. Docker eliminate chance of missing production dependency during deployment.
  - Developers can easily upgrade .NET version by switching the version number in dockerfile. Developer can utilize latest technology without relying on developer of build pack to release the upgrade.
  - Developers can customize additional software on the image running your app. Docker provides reliable way to install additional software on the OS level using Dockerfile. Developers are free to install additional packages on the OS. This makes infrastructure customizable by developers.
