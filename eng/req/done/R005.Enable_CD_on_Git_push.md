#### Story:
As a developer<br/>
I want to release my application on Git push<br/>
So that I can easily and quickly deploy updates to my application.

#### Design options evaluated:
1. Use Heroku to deploy to build and deploy the Docker image. Use heroku.yml file to build and automatically deploy docker file.
   - Pros:
     - No additional service is required. Heroku will know how to build Docker image using description heroku.yml file. Heroku can automatically deploy after the image is built.
1. Use other CD tools to build the Docker image and push the image to Heroku.
   - Pros:
     - This is more standard approach of the deployment. This flow could be used with most CD tools.
   - Cons:
     - Needs to setup and maintain some CD service like Jenkins.


#### Selected design option: 1
- Reasons for the selection:
  - Heroku's built in functionality to create new deployment seems most strait forward. Looks like the will be work for long time without breaking and is very easy to get started with.
  - We had looked at doing CD by pushing image from Azure DevOps CD pipeline. But we decided to not take that route. The primary reason was that it required configuration done using the UI tool. There doesn't seem to be way to put those steps in config file and committing the configuration to repository, like you can do with Azure DevOps CI.
