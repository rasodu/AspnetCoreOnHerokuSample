#### Story:
As an application manager<br/>
I want to make sure that the changes are tested well and we follow software engineering process to deploy the changes<br/>
So that we can deliver the best software for our customer.

#### Design options evaluated:
1. Industry standard
   - Pros:
     - Each role involved in the software development life cycle has a separate place to look the updated software
     - Can hide some production data from some of the people involved in software development.
     - Allows testing by various group of people.
   - Cons:
     - Expensive to build since it requires number of different environment
   - Notes:
     - | Emergency deployment order | Normal deployment order | Environment Name | Environment usage | Has production data? | Auto deployed branch |
       |---|---|---|---|---|---|
       | 1 | N/A | PRODFIX | Emergency patches are tested here by actual users  | Yes | Deployed manually |
       | N/A | N/A | Sendbox | Playground for developers | No | Deployed manually |
       | N/A | 1 | DEV | For developer to make sure that everything from master branch work | No | deplyed from master |
       | N/A | 2 | SIT | System integration testing - QA team can verify that everything is working | No | Moved manually from DEV |
       | N/A | 3 | UAT | User acceptance testing - Actual customers can verify that everything is working | Yes | Moved manually from SIT |
       | 2 | 4 | PROD | Actual users will use this environment | Yes | Moved manually from UAT |
       | 2 | 4 | BCP | Actual users will use this environment if there is a problem with PROD | Yes | Moved manually from UAT |
