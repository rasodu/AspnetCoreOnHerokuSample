#### Story:
As a package implementer<br/>
I want to choose best dockerfile naming convention<br/>
So that the users of the package fewer problem when using the package

#### Design options evaluated:
1. Name dockerfile, "Dockerfile.Web", according to Heroku convention
   - Pros:
     - Can push all images in current directory with a single command: [heroku container:push --recursive](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime#pushing-multiple-images)
   - Cons:
     - If this way is used for deployment, then there is no way to run release tasks.
1. Name dockerfile "DockerfileWeb"
   - Pros:
     - Avoid mistakenly push to deployment with single Heroku command. 

#### Selected design option: 2
- Reasons for the selection:
  - We plan to implement git push to deploy functionality. Therefore, breaking functionality of Heroku push command is OK.
  - We need release tasks to function because we plan to provide functionality to migrate database when deploying new version using release tasks.
