#### Story:
As a developer<br/>
I want run unit tests automatically before deployment<br/>
So that application is not deployed if unit tests for the application fails

#### Design options evaluated:
- Ways to build pipeline.
  1. Test in the build pipeline
     - Pros:
       - With this approach the tool will be intelligently gather data from test run and create reports.
     - Cons:
       - But you may have to customize given environment with additional tools to have your code build and tested.
  1. Test in docker
     - Pros:
       - You are already building the image for deployment. So not much effort is needed to setup the environment.
     - Cons:
       - Pipeline tool will not be able to pull test result.
     - Notes:
       - The two technical ways to implement CI are discussed in Microsoft [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/docker?view=vsts&tabs=yaml#integrate-build-and-test-tasks).
- Types of CI.
    1. Full CI. This is what it means when we call CI.
       - Each pull request will run all unit tests and show their status on pull request.
       - There is no easy way to enable full CI. You need to purchase Heroku CI or user service like Azure DevOps which provide free CI time.
       - We have decided to not enable full CI at this point. It will make setting up project more complicated. And we want to stick with Heroku.
       - Developer can easy enable full CI support by making minor modifications.
    1. Run test before deployment.
       - This will make sure test are run successfully before each deployment. But it will not give developer feedback right when they are writing their code. In case tests fail, then developer may have to go back to the code that they have written earlier and fix the tests.
       - If a unit test is failing, then developer will be unable to deploy the code.
       - This approach will provide a runway that developers will be able to use to setup full CI.

#### Selected design option: ii & ii
- Reasons for the selection:
  - To keep the setup simple. We have decided to not do full CI at this point.
